          An authentication token, like a personal access token (PAT), that provides write access to the repository and
          can be used to merge the pull request. This is necessary because when a pull request is merged while being
          authenticated with the default GITHUB_TOKEN of a workflow run, then the merge won't trigger other workflows
          (like a build workflow on the target branch). This is an intentional limitation, see:
          https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow.
          Thus, we need to use an alternative authentication token. See
          https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
          for info on how to create PATs; you'll need one with the "repo" scope. Check out
          https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/main/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#triggering-further-workflow-runs
          for instructions on what other tokens you can use.
