        description: >
          If set to "true", the NuGet packages will be cached by GitHub. This is faster if you have a lot of NuGet

          Change this to any other value to alter the cache key, effectively invalidating the latest cache. This is the
          easiest current way to force "clear" the cache
          (https://github.community/t/how-to-clear-cache-in-github-actions/129038/5) until the associated issue
          (https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/2) is resolved and the feature is available not just via the RESTful
          API.
