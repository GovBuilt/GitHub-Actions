# First, we globally set test configurations using environment variables. Then acquire the list of all test projects
# (excluding the two test libraries) and then run each until one fails or all concludes. If a test fails, the output is
# sanitized from unnecessary diagnostics messages from chromedriver if the output doesn't already contain groupings,
# then it wraps them in "::group::<project name>". If there are already groupings, then it is not possible to nest them
# (https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/802) so that's omitted. The groupings make the output collapsible region on
# the Actions web UI. Note that we use bash to output the log using bash to avoid pwsh wrapping the output to the
# default buffer width.
