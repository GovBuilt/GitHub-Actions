      # If this is run for a PR opened from a fork (not from a branch in the given repo) then "Resource not accessible
      # by integration" errors can happen. Thus, not running it for forks during the pull_request event (but it can
      # run during push, for example). See https://github.com/Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/issues/72 for details.
