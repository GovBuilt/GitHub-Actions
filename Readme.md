# Lombiq GitHub Actions

## About

Some common workflows and actions for Github Actions shared between Lombiq projects, e.g. to build and test [Orchard Core](https://www.orchardcore.net/) apps, publish packages to NuGet, verify that a Git submodule pull request has a corresponding superproject one. These can be invoked from any other repository's build.
