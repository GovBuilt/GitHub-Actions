# Lombiq GitHub Actions

## About

Reusable workflows and actions for GitHub Actions shared between Lombiq projects, for example:

- Build and test [Orchard Core](https://www.orchardcore.net/) apps
- Build and test .NET Framework and .NET Core applications in general
- Publish packages to NuGet
- Verify and validate pull requests
- Check spelling
- Perform static code analysis and linting
- Deploy to an Azure App Service, swap staging and production slots, and copy production data to the staging site
- And more!

These can be invoked from any other repository's build.

[Check out a demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhMnX0TsybM) on our YouTube channel, and the Orchard Harvest 2023 conference talk about automated QA in Orchard Core [here](https://youtu.be/CHdhwD2NHBU).

We at [Lombiq](https://lombiq.com/) also used these workflows for the following projects:

- The new [Lombiq website](https://lombiq.com/) when migrating it from Orchard 1 to Orchard Core ([see case study](https://lombiq.com/blog/how-we-renewed-and-migrated-lombiq-com-from-orchard-1-to-orchard-core)).
- The new client portal for [Willis Towers Watson](https://www.wtwco.com/) ([see case study](https://lombiq.com/blog/lombiqs-journey-with-willis-towers-watsons-client-portal)).
- They also make [DotNest, the Orchard SaaS](https://dotnest.com/) better.
