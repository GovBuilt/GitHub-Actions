# Reusable GitHub Actions workflows

These workflows can be invoked from a step from any other repository's workflow. The utilize [our composite actions](Actions.md).

## General notes

- In addition to the below short explanations and samples, check out the inline documentation of the workflow you want to use, especially its parameters. These examples don't necessarily utilize all parameters.
- Workflows with a `cancel-workflow-on-failure` parameter will by default cancel all jobs in the workflow run when the given reusable workflow fails (to save computing resources). You can disable this by setting the parameter to `"false"`.
- To add the workflows to a project create a folder in the root of the repository that will call them, e.g. _.github/workflows/build.yml_ and/or _.github/workflows/publish.yml_. Things to keep in mind:
    - If you have multiple projects in the repository or if the project you want to build is in a subfolder, then add a solution to the root of the repository that references all projects you want to build.
    - References to projects (`<ProjectReference>` elements) not in the repository won't work, these need to be changed to package references (`<PackageReference>` elements). Make the conditional based on `$(NuGetBuild)`. See the [Helpful Extensions project file](https://github.com/Lombiq/Helpful-Extensions/blob/dev/Lombiq.HelpfulExtensions.csproj) for an example. References to projects in the repository will work and those projects, if configured with the proper metadata, will be published together, with dependencies retained among the packages too.
    - Projects building client-side assets with [Gulp Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Gulp-Extensions) won't work during such builds. Until [we fix this](https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions/issues/48), you have to commit the _wwwroot_ folder to the repository and add the same conditional to the Gulp and NPM Import elements too ([example](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Data-Tables/blob/58458b5d6381c71c094cb8d960e12b15a59f62d7/Lombiq.DataTables/Lombiq.DataTables.csproj#L33-L35)).

## Build and Test Orchard Core solution workflow

Meant to be used with [Orchard Core](https://orchardcore.net/) solutions; this workflow checks out the code, installs dependencies, builds the solution, runs unit and UI tests (with [Lombiq UI Testing Toolbox for Orchard Core](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox)), and publishes artifacts as well as a test report.

For an example of this, see below and the workflow of [Lombiq's Open-Source Orchard Core Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions).

```yaml
name: Build and Test

# Runs for PRs opened for any branch, and pushes to the dev branch.
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev

jobs:
  call-build-and-test-workflow:
    name: Build and Test
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/build-and-test-orchard-core.yml@dev
    with:
      timeout-minutes: 60
```

## Build .NET solution workflow

Builds a .NET solution (or project) with static code analysis. You can use it along the lines of the following:

```yaml
name: Build

# Runs for PRs opened for any branch, and pushes to the dev branch.
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev

jobs:
  call-build-workflow:
    name: Build
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/build-dotnet.yml@dev
    with:
      machine-types: "[\"ubuntu-latest\", \"windows-latest\"]"
      timeout-minutes: 10
```

## Spelling workflow

Checks for spelling mistakes in a repository using the [Check Spelling](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/check-spelling) GitHub Action. There are 3 configuration files for filtering false positives:

- _`excludes.txt`_: This file includes file names and extensions to be ignored.
- _`expect.txt`_: This file contains plain text words that would be considered a spelling mistake.
- _`allow.txt`_: Same function as `expect.txt`. Out of convention this file contains meaningful words, while `expect.txt` everything else.
- _`patterns.txt`_: This file contains patterns that would be considered a spelling mistake.

There are more configuration files available, for more information visit the action's [wiki](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Configuration#files).

You can provide these files in your own repository, under the path `.github/actions/spelling`. This can't be configured for another path.

You can also use already existing configuration files by setting the `spell-check-this` parameter to another existing repository, where the files are found in the above-mentioned path. This parameter is needed even if you want to update our dictionary in a custom branch of project consuming this workflow; changing just the workflow's branch from `dev` to your branch won't take any effect, you can leave it as it is.

Example _check-spelling.yml_:

```yaml
name: Spelling

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev

jobs:
  spelling:
    name: Spelling
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/spelling.yml@dev
```

## NuGet publish workflow

Builds the project with the .NET SDK and publishes it as a NuGet package to the configured NuGet feed. Example _publish.yml_:

```yaml
name: Publish to NuGet

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v*

jobs:
  call-publish-workflow:
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/publish-nuget.yml@dev
    secrets:
      apikey: ${{ secrets.DEFAULT_NUGET_PUBLISH_API_KEY }}
```

The _publish.yml_ workflow is triggered on a tag pushed to any branch with the prefix `v` and should contain a [valid version number](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/package-versioning#version-basics), e.g. `v1.0.1`, which will be extracted and used to version the NuGet packages produced.

There is no configuration required for automated Orchard Core extension manifest versioning, all of the `Manifest.cs` files are looked up, and the existing `Version` properties are updated automatically inside the `Module` or `Theme` definition with the version pushed. Note that the `Version` property should be present and leave the version number on the default value (0.0.1). This is because we don't actually need to keep manifest version changes in the code.

It takes one non-optional secret parameter, `apikey`, the organization API key for pushing to NuGet, and two optional parameters, `source` and `verbosity`. E.g.:

```yaml
jobs:
  call-publish-workflow:
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/publish-nuget.yml@dev
    with:
      source: https://nuget.cloudsmith.io/lombiq/open-source-orchard-core-extensions/v3/index.json
      verbosity: detailed
    secrets:
      apikey: ${{ secrets.CLOUDSMITH_NUGET_PUBLISH_API_KEY }}
```

When `source` is not provided, it assumes a default value of pushing to the [Lombiq NuGet feed](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Lombiq).

Valid values for `verbosity` are those defined by [MSBuild](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-command-line-reference?view=vs-2022#:~:text=you%20can%20specify%20the%20following%20verbosity%20levels). The default value is `minimal`.

## Submodule validate workflow

Validates if the submodule pull request's title contains a Jira-style issue code (e.g. PROJ-123), and if it contains the issue code with the link to the Jira issue in the body (or adds both if it can be figured out from the branch name). Also checks if a pull request exists for the parent module. Example _validate-submodule-pull-request.yml_:

```yaml
name: Validate Submodule Pull Request

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  call-validate-workflow:
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/validate-submodule-pull-request.yml@dev
    with:
      repository: Lombiq/Hastlayer-SDK
```

If this is for a submodule of [Lombiq's Open-Source Orchard Core Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions/), the `repo` input can be omitted, because the above is its default value. Otherwise, use your parent repository's address in the `{owner}/{repo_name}` format.

Refer to [Github Actions reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/reusing-workflows#overview) for more information.

## Deploy to Azure App Service workflow

This workflow builds and publishes a .NET web project and then deploys the app to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/). The workflow also supports [Ready to Run compilation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run). Example _deploy-to-azure-app-service.yml_:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Azure App Service

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  call-deploy-workflow:
    name: Deploy to Azure App Service
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/deploy-to-azure-app-service.yml@dev
    with:
      timeout-minutes: 60
      app-name: AppName
      resource-group-name: ResourceGroupName
      slot-name: Staging
      url: https://www.myapp.com
      runtime: win-x86
      self-contained: true
      ready-to-run: true
    secrets:
      AZURE_APP_SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL: ${{ secrets.AZURE_APP_SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL }}
      AZURE_APP_SERVICE_PUBLISH_PROFILE: ${{ secrets.AZURE_APP_SERVICE_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
```

## Validate Pull Request workflow

Validates if the pull request's title contains a Jira-style issue code (e.g. PROJ-123), and if it contains the issue code with the link to the Jira issue in the body (or adds both if it can be figured out from the branch name). Also labels and comments on pull requests with merge conflicts.

```yaml
name: Validate Pull Request
on:
  push:
  pull_request:
    types: [synchronize]

jobs:
  validate-pull-request:
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/validate-pull-request.yml@dev
```

## Jira issue creation for community activities workflow

Creates Jira issues for community activities happening on GitHub, like issues, discussions, and pull requests being opened. Pull requests are only taken into account if they're not already related to a Jira issue (by starting their title with a Jira issue key).

Set up secrets for the `JIRA_*` parameters as explained [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-login#enviroment-variables). You may use secret names without the `DEFAULT_*` prefix, but that's our recommendation for organization-level secrets, so you have defaults but can override them on a per-repository basis.

The secrets with the `*_JIRA_ISSUE_DESCRIPTION` suffix should contain templates for the Jira issues to be created, using the internal markup format of Jira (not Markdown). Example for one for `ISSUE_JIRA_ISSUE_DESCRIPTION`:

```text
h1. Summary
See the linked GitHub issue, including all the comments.

h1. Checklist
* Assign yourself to the referenced GitHub issue.
* [Issue completion checklist|https://example.com/checklist]
```

All three templates are optional and if not provided, defaults will be used.

```yaml
name: Create Jira issues for community activities

on:
  discussion:
    types: created
  issues:
    types: opened
  pull_request:
    types: opened

jobs:
  call-publish-workflow:
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/create-jira-issues-for-community-activities.yml@dev
    secrets:
      JIRA_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DEFAULT_JIRA_BASE_URL }}
      JIRA_USER_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.DEFAULT_JIRA_USER_EMAIL }}
      JIRA_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEFAULT_JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
      JIRA_PROJECT_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEFAULT_JIRA_PROJECT_KEY }}
      DISCUSSION_JIRA_ISSUE_DESCRIPTION: ${{ secrets.DEFAULT_DISCUSSION_JIRA_ISSUE_DESCRIPTION }}
      ISSUE_JIRA_ISSUE_DESCRIPTION: ${{ secrets.DEFAULT_ISSUE_JIRA_ISSUE_DESCRIPTION }}
      PULL_REQUEST_JIRA_ISSUE_DESCRIPTION: ${{ secrets.DEFAULT_PULL_REQUEST_JIRA_ISSUE_DESCRIPTION }}
    with:
      issue-component: Lombiq.MyProject

```

## Reset Azure Environment workflow

This workflow resets an Azure Environment, by replacing the Orchard Core Media Library and the Database with the ones from a given source slot. Example _reset-azure-environment.yml_:

```yaml
name: Reset Azure Environment

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  call-reset-azure-environment-workflow:
    name: Reset Azure Environment
    uses: Lombiq/GitHub-Actions/.github/workflows/reset-azure-environment.yml@dev
    with:
      timeout-minutes: 60
      app-name: AppName
      resource-group-name: ResourceGroupName
      database-connection-string-name: Database__ConnectionString
      master-database-connection-string-name: Database__ConnectionString-master
      storage-connection-string-name: Storage_ConnectionString
    secrets:
      AZURE_APP_SERVICE_RESET_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL: ${{ secrets.AZURE_APP_RESET_ENVIRONMENT_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL }}
```
