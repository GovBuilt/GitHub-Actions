# Composite GitHub Actions actions

These actions can be invoked from a step in any other repository's workflow. They're utilized by [our reusable workflows](Workflows.md).

In addition to the below short explanations, check out the inline documentation of the action you want to use, especially its parameters.

- `add-jira-issue-code-to-pull-request`: Adds the Jira issue key prefix and link to pull requests.
- `auto-merge-pull-request`: Merges the current pull request automatically if the "merge-and-resolve-jira-issue-if-checks-succeed" or "merge-if-checks-succeed" label is present.
- `auto-resolve-done-jira-issue`: Resolves the Jira issue corresponding to the pull request if the "resolve-jira-issue-if-checks-succeed" or "merge-and-resolve-jira-issue-if-checks-succeed" label is present, or sets the issue to Done if the "done-jira-issue-if-checks-succeed" label is.
- `build-dotnet`: Builds all .NET solutions or projects in the given directory with optional static code analysis.
- `cancel-workflow`: Cancels the current workflow run, i.e. all jobs. Useful if you want to cancel the rest of the workflow when one job fails. Suitable workflows in this project expose this functionality via the `cancel-workflow-on-failure` parameter.
- `check-merge-conflict`: Labels and comments on pull requests with merge conflicts.
- `create-jira-issues-for-community-activities`: Creates Jira issues for community activities happening on GitHub, like issues, discussions, and pull requests being opened. Pull requests are only taken into account if they're not already related to a Jira issue (by starting their title with a Jira issue key).
- `enable-corepack`: Enables [Node corepack](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/corepack.html) so any package manager can be used seamlessly.
- `publish-nuget`: Publishes the content of the current directory as a NuGet package.
- `setup-azurite`: Sets up the [Azurite Azure Blob Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) via NPM.
- `setup-dotnet`: Sets up the .NET SDK.
- `setup-sql-server`: Sets up SQL Server with Lombiq-recommended defaults.
- `spelling`: Checks for spelling mistakes in a repository.
- `test-dotnet`: Runs .NET unit and UI tests (with the [Lombiq UI Testing Toolbox for Orchard Core](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox)), generates a test report, and uploads UI testing failure dumps to artifacts.
- `verify-dotnet-consolidation`: Verifies that the NuGet packages of a .NET solution are consolidated, i.e. the same version of a given package is used in all projects.
- `verify-submodule-pull-request`: Assuming that the current repository is a submodule in another repository, this action verifies that a pull request with a matching issue code has been opened there as well.
